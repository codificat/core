# SIG User Experience Charter

This charter adheres to the conventions described in the [Kubernetes Charter README] and uses
the Roles and Organization Management outlined in Kuberentes' [sig-governance]. For all things taken from the Kubernetes
community, we use scaled down variants, Kubernetes documents are references.

## Scope

user experience.

This includes the interaction with human users (be it though direct component
usage, API invocations, or through indirect actions like GitHub issues that
require Thoth bots intervention) as well as machine-oriented interfaces.

### Out of scope

- SIG User Experience is not responsible for the implementation of new features.

## Roles and Organization Management
